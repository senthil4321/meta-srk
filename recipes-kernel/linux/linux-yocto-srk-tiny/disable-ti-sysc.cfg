# Fix TI SYSC probe failures - approach: reduce log level instead of disabling functionality
# The probe failures are often harmless - devices may be disabled in device tree or already claimed

# Option 1: Reduce TI SYSC driver log level to reduce noise
# (This requires a kernel patch or device tree change)

# Option 2: Disable specific problematic modules that we don't need anyway

# These are the modules causing the probe failures:
# 44e31000: Control Module WKUP domain 
# 48040000: USB0 module

# Since we already disabled USB_SUPPORT, also disable OMAP-specific USB configs
# CONFIG_USB_DWC3_OMAP is not set
# CONFIG_USB_MUSB_HDRC is not set
# CONFIG_USB_MUSB_OMAP2PLUS is not set

# Disable OMAP control PHY since we don't need USB
# CONFIG_OMAP_CONTROL_PHY is not set
# CONFIG_OMAP_USB2 is not set
# CONFIG_OMAP_USB3 is not set

# Disable other OMAP features we don't need for minimal kernel
# CONFIG_OMAP2_DSS is not set
# CONFIG_OMAP_HWMOD is not set

# Alternative: Just comment the errors as "expected and harmless"
# These errors indicate unused hardware modules which is exactly what we want
