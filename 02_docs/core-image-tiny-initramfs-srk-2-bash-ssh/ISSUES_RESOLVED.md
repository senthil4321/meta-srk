# Fixes and Issues Resolution Log

## Summary of Issues Fixed

This document tracks all the issues encountered during development and their resolutions.

## Issue #1: SSH Root Login Rejected - Invalid Shell

### Date
October 19, 2025

### Problem
```
User 'root' has invalid shell, rejected
```
SSH login for root user was being rejected by Dropbear SSH server.

### Root Cause
- `/etc/shells` file was missing `/bin/bash` entry
- Dropbear validates user shells against `/etc/shells`
- Root user was configured with `/bin/bash` but it wasn't listed as valid

### Investigation
1. Checked `/etc/passwd`: root had `/bin/bash` shell
2. Checked `/etc/shells`: only contained `/bin/sh` and `/usr/bin/bash`
3. Dropbear requires shell to be listed in `/etc/shells`

### Solution

Modified `fix_shell_prompt()` function in recipe to create proper `/etc/shells`:

```bash
cat > ${IMAGE_ROOTFS}/etc/shells << 'EOF'
# /etc/shells: valid login shells
/bin/sh
/bin/bash
/usr/bin/bash
EOF
```

### Verification

```bash

ssh root@192.168.1.200 "whoami"
# Output: root ✅
```

### Status

✅ **RESOLVED**

## Issue #2: SSH SRK User Login Rejected - Invalid Shell

### Date

October 19, 2025

### Problem

```
User 'srk' has invalid shell, rejected
```
SSH login for srk user was being rejected by Dropbear SSH server.

### Root Cause
Same as Issue #1 - `/etc/shells` was missing `/bin/bash` entry

### Solution
Same fix as Issue #1 - already resolved by fixing `/etc/shells`

### Verification
```bash
ssh srk@192.168.1.200 "whoami"
# Output: srk ✅
```

### Status
✅ **RESOLVED**

## Issue #3: systemd-logind Service Failures

### Date
October 19, 2025

### Problem
```
systemd-logind.service: Failed to start User Login Management
systemd-logind.service: Failed to spawn 'start-pre' task: Not a directory
```

### Root Cause
Multiple issues:
1. ExecStartPre commands were using `/bin/sh` which is a symlink
2. Some systemd runtime directories were missing
3. chmod commands were failing in ExecStartPre
4. systemd couldn't spawn the pre-start tasks properly

### Investigation Steps
1. Checked journal logs: `journalctl -u systemd-logind`
2. Found "Not a directory" and "resources" errors
3. Tested bash execution manually: `/usr/bin/bash.bash -c 'echo test'`
4. Checked systemd override configuration

### Solutions Attempted

#### Attempt 1: Fix ExecStartPre to use bash
Changed from `/bin/sh` to `/usr/bin/bash.bash` in override.conf

#### Attempt 2: Remove problematic chmod commands
Removed chmod operations that were causing failures:
```bash
# Before (failing):
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/bash.bash -c 'chmod 755 /run/systemd'
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/bash.bash -c 'chmod 755 /run/user'

# After (working):
# Removed chmod commands, directories created with correct permissions
```

#### Attempt 3: Service runs but with resource errors
Service still had issues, but SSH functionality was not affected

### Final Resolution
- Disabled systemd-logind service as it's not required for minimal embedded system
- SSH and all core functionality work perfectly without it
- Command: `systemctl disable --now systemd-logind`

### Verification
```bash
ssh srk@192.168.1.200 "echo 'SSH works without systemd-logind'"
# Output: SSH works without systemd-logind ✅
```

### Status
✅ **RESOLVED** (service disabled, not required)

## Issue #4: Bash Completion Not Working

### Date
October 19, 2025 (Initial setup)

### Problem
Tab completion was not functional in bash sessions

### Root Cause
1. bash-completion package was missing
2. No completion scripts were installed
3. `/etc/profile` wasn't sourcing bash completion

### Solution
1. Added `bash-completion` to `IMAGE_INSTALL`
2. Created `install_bash_completions()` function in recipe
3. Added completion scripts for `ls` and `cd` commands
4. Modified `/etc/profile` to source bash completion:
```bash
if [ -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then
    . /etc/bash_completion
elif [ -f /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ]; then
    . /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
fi
```

### Verification
```bash
ssh srk@192.168.1.200 "ls -lh /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/"
# Output: 
# cd (353 bytes) ✅
# ls (922 bytes) ✅
```

### Status
✅ **RESOLVED** (infrastructure installed, interactive testing pending)

## Issue #5: /etc/profile Syntax Error

### Date
October 19, 2025

### Problem
Bash syntax error in `/etc/profile` - missing closing `fi` statement

### Root Cause
During development, the bash completion if-block was added but the closing `fi` was missing

### Investigation
```bash
ssh srk@192.168.1.200 "bash -n /etc/profile"
# Would have shown syntax error if tested
```

### Solution
Added missing `fi` statement to close the bash completion if-block:
```bash
if [ -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then
    . /etc/bash_completion
elif [ -f /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ]; then
    . /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
fi  # <- This was missing
```

### Verification
```bash
ssh srk@192.168.1.200 "cat /etc/profile"
# Verified proper if/elif/fi structure ✅
```

### Status
✅ **RESOLVED**

---

## Issue #6: systemd Journal Permission Errors

### Date
October 19, 2025

### Problem
Users couldn't access systemd journal logs:
```
No journal files were opened due to insufficient permissions.
```

### Root Cause
- Journal directory didn't exist or had wrong permissions
- systemd-journal group ownership missing

### Solution
Added to `fix_systemd_services()` function:
```bash
mkdir -p ${IMAGE_ROOTFS}/var/volatile/log/journal
chmod 2755 ${IMAGE_ROOTFS}/var/volatile/log/journal
chown root:systemd-journal ${IMAGE_ROOTFS}/var/volatile/log/journal 2>/dev/null || true
```

### Verification
```bash
ssh root@192.168.1.200 "journalctl -n 10 --no-pager"
# Shows recent journal entries ✅
```

### Status
✅ **RESOLVED**

---

## Issue #7: Host Key Changed After Rebuild

### Date
October 19, 2025 (During clean build testing)

### Problem
```
WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!
```

### Root Cause
Dropbear generates new SSH host keys on each deployment, causing SSH client to detect a change

### Solution
This is expected behavior. Remove old key:
```bash
ssh-keygen -f "/home/srk2cob/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "192.168.1.200"
```

Or use `-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no` flag for testing

### Status
✅ **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR** (documented in troubleshooting)

---

## Build Warnings

### Warning: sysusers.d User Definition Mismatch

#### Message
```
WARNING: core-image-tiny-initramfs-srk-2-bash-ssh-1.0-r0 do_rootfs: 
User root has been defined as (root, 0, 0, root, /root, /bin/bash) 
but sysusers.d expects it as (root, 0, 0, Super User, /home/root, -)
```

#### Impact
None - This is a cosmetic warning. Root user is properly configured and functional.

#### Explanation
- Recipe sets root home to `/root` and shell to `/bin/bash`
- systemd's sysusers.d has different defaults
- Runtime configuration from recipe takes precedence
- SSH login works correctly

#### Status
⚠️ **COSMETIC WARNING** (no functional impact)

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Shell Validation
- Always ensure shells used are listed in `/etc/shells`
- Dropbear strictly validates shells against this file
- Test with both root and regular users

### 2. systemd in Embedded Systems
- systemd-logind is optional for minimal systems
- Not all systemd features are needed for embedded use
- SSH works fine without systemd-logind
- Focus on essential services only

### 3. Bash Completion
- Requires bash-completion package
- Needs proper sourcing in profile/bashrc
- Scripts must be in correct directory
- Interactive testing needed to fully verify

### 4. ExecStartPre in systemd
- Be careful with shell interpreters
- Avoid complex operations in ExecStartPre
- Use `-` prefix to make commands optional: `ExecStartPre=-/bin/command`
- Test manually before adding to service files

### 5. NFS Root Development
- Direct file editing on NFS useful for quick fixes
- Always update recipe for persistence
- Clean builds verify all changes are in recipe
- Serial console access is invaluable

---

## Best Practices Established

### Development Workflow
1. Identify issue via SSH or serial console
2. Test fix directly on NFS filesystem
3. Update recipe with fix
4. Clean build to verify
5. Deploy and test again

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] SSH login as root
- [ ] SSH login as regular user
- [ ] Check /etc/shells
- [ ] Verify bash completion files
- [ ] Check system services
- [ ] Verify configuration files

### Documentation
- Track all issues and resolutions
- Document root causes
- Include verification commands
- Note lessons learned
