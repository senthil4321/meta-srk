# SCSI Configuration Analysis Summary

## Problem Statement
During Linux kernel size optimization for a minimal BeagleBone Black system, we encountered an issue where `CONFIG_SCSI` could be disabled but `CONFIG_SCSI_MOD` remained enabled despite attempts to disable it.

## Investigation Findings

### Initial Observations
- Kernel size: 4.51 MB (target: minimize for embedded system)
- `CONFIG_SCSI` was successfully disabled (`# CONFIG_SCSI is not set`)
- `CONFIG_SCSI_MOD=y` remained enabled despite disable attempts
- No ATA, USB storage, or other storage drivers were enabled
- System requirements: UART console only, no networking/storage

### Root Cause Analysis

#### 1. Kconfig Dependency Investigation
- Searched for what selects `CONFIG_SCSI` → Found ATA subsystem selects SCSI
- ATA was not enabled (`# CONFIG_ATA is not set`)
- Searched for what selects `CONFIG_SCSI_MOD` → No direct selections found

#### 2. Kernel Feature Analysis
- Identified that Yocto kernel includes `features/scsi/scsi.scc` by default
- This feature enables `CONFIG_SCSI=y` in the standard kernel type
- Excluded SCSI features using: `KERNEL_FEATURES:remove = "features/scsi/scsi.scc features/scsi/scsi-debug.scc"`

#### 3. Defconfig Investigation
- Found `CONFIG_SCSI_MOD=y` in the custom defconfig file
- Modified defconfig to disable: `# CONFIG_SCSI_MOD is not set`
- Issue persisted due to Kconfig default behavior

### Critical Discovery: Kconfig Default Logic

The root cause was found in the kernel's Kconfig system:

```kconfig
config SCSI_MOD
    tristate
    default y if SCSI=n || SCSI=y    # ← KEY INSIGHT
    default m if SCSI=m
    depends on BLOCK
```

**Explanation:**
- When `CONFIG_SCSI=n` (disabled), `CONFIG_SCSI_MOD` defaults to `y`
- When `CONFIG_SCSI=y` (enabled), `CONFIG_SCSI_MOD` defaults to `y`
- When `CONFIG_SCSI=m` (module), `CONFIG_SCSI_MOD` defaults to `m`

This is **by design** - `CONFIG_SCSI_MOD` provides core SCSI infrastructure that may be needed by other kernel components, even when no SCSI drivers are enabled.

### Resolution Attempts

#### Attempt 1: Direct Disable in Recipe
- Added sed commands to remove existing `CONFIG_SCSI_MOD` lines
- Added echo commands to set `# CONFIG_SCSI_MOD is not set`
- **Result:** Failed - Kconfig defaults override explicit disables

#### Attempt 2: Kernel Type Change
- Changed `LINUX_KERNEL_TYPE = "tiny"` to use minimal kernel configuration
- **Result:** Failed - No BSP definition for `beaglebone-yocto-srk-tiny/tiny`

#### Attempt 3: Feature Exclusion
- Used `KERNEL_FEATURES:remove` to exclude SCSI features
- **Result:** Successful - Eliminated SCSI-related warnings

#### Attempt 4: Post-Processing Override
- Added disable command after `olddefconfig` dependency resolution
- **Result:** Failed - Kconfig system still enforces defaults

### Final Resolution

**Accepted that `CONFIG_SCSI_MOD=y` is required** when `CONFIG_SCSI=n` due to kernel design.

**Verification:** Kernel size analysis showed `CONFIG_SCSI_MOD=y` has minimal impact:
- No SCSI drivers appear in top size contributors
- Kernel size reduced from 4.51 MB → 3.53 MB
- Drivers section reduced from 1.24 MB → 760.27 KB

## Key Learnings

1. **Kconfig Defaults Override Explicit Disables**: When a config has `default y` conditions, those defaults take precedence over explicit `# CONFIG_X is not set` statements.

2. **SCSI_MOD is Core Infrastructure**: Provides essential SCSI support functions that may be used by other subsystems, even when no SCSI drivers are enabled.

3. **Minimal Impact When No Drivers Enabled**: `CONFIG_SCSI_MOD=y` adds negligible size when no actual SCSI/ATA/storage drivers are enabled.

4. **Yocto Kernel Features**: The standard kernel type includes many features by default. Use `KERNEL_FEATURES:remove` to exclude unwanted features.

## Configuration Summary

**Final Working Configuration:**
```bash
# Disable main SCSI support
echo "# CONFIG_SCSI is not set" >> ${B}/.config

# Exclude SCSI features from kernel build
KERNEL_FEATURES:remove = "features/scsi/scsi.scc features/scsi/scsi-debug.scc"

# CONFIG_SCSI_MOD remains y (by design) but has minimal size impact
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Kernel: 3.53 MB (down from 4.51 MB)
- ✅ Drivers: 760.27 KB (down from 1.24 MB)
- ✅ All storage/networking drivers disabled
- ✅ CONFIG_SCSI_MOD enabled but no size penalty

## Recommendations

1. **For Minimal Kernels**: Accept that `CONFIG_SCSI_MOD=y` when `CONFIG_SCSI=n` - it's harmless
2. **Use Feature Exclusion**: `KERNEL_FEATURES:remove` is effective for removing unwanted kernel features
3. **Check Kconfig Defaults**: When configs can't be disabled, check for `default` statements in Kconfig files
4. **Size Analysis**: Use tools like `ksize.py` to verify actual size impact of configuration changes
